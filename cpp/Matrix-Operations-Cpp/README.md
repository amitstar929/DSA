# 📐 Matrix Operations in C++ (Console Based)

A menu-driven **Matrix Operations project in C++** using
dynamic memory allocation and clean modular functions.

This project is created for **learning purposes** and focuses on:
- Core C++ concepts
- Pointer-based 2D arrays
- Functions & memory management
- User-friendly input handling

---

## 🚀 Features

✔ Addition of two matrices  
✔ Multiplication of two matrices  
✔ Transpose of a matrix  
✔ Dynamic memory allocation (`new` / `delete`)  
✔ Input validation (no garbage input allowed)  
✔ Colorful console output (ANSI escape codes)  
✔ Menu-driven interface

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- C++ Functions
- Pointers & Double Pointers (`int**`)
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Call by Reference
- Nested loops
- Input validation using `cin.fail()`
- Modular programming
